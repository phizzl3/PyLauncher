# PyLauncher

Pull together individual scripts/repos from a folder and launch them using the command line.

## Plans

* Put individual repos in same (code) folder
* Use Pathlib to get current/parent/parent folder
* Look for specified .py files in contained folders (code)
* Display those as a menu
* Launch .py files and their envs (one line) using cli commands
* Figure out if I can return to the menu script once the other terminates
